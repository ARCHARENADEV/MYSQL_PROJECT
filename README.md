# MYSQL_PROJECT
MYSQL PROJECT This Library Management System helps keep track of library resources using a database. It uses tables to store information about library branches, staff, books, members, and borrowing status. This helps with tasks like checking book availability, member interactions, and staff roles. The system also provides useful reports on things like book availability, staff salaries, and member activity. This organized approach makes it easier to find and use information, helping with decision-making and daily management. The project shows how important it is to design a good database to manage complex information and support library operations
